# BLIP-2 notebooks

This folder contains notebooks to illustate Salesforce's BLIP-2 model in ðŸ¤— Transformers.

The model can be used to caption images, answer questions related to images, or even chat in a conversational manner similar to Deepmind's [Flamingo](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/tackling-multiple-tasks-with-a-single-visual-language-model).

BLIP-2 even beats Flamingo on several benchmarks, despite being a lot smaller, leveraging open-source large language models like [OPT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/opt) and [Flan-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5).
