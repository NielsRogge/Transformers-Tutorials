# Mask2Former notebooks

Note: [Mask2Former](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mask2former) has the same API as MaskFormer, hence you can use all notebooks found [here](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/MaskFormer)
regarding fine-tuning on a custom dataset for instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation. 

This folder just contains a notebook illustrating inference with Mask2Former on new images.
