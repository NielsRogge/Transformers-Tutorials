        "## Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an LLM\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that creating a ChatGPT at home involves 3 steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. pre-training a large language model (LLM) to predict the next token on internet-scale data, on clusters of thousands of GPUs. One calls the result a \"base model\"\n",
        "2. supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to turn the base model into a useful assistant\n",
        "3. human preference fine-tuning which increases the assistant's friendliness, helpfulness and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 2. This involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT for short), also called instruction tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised fine-tuning takes in a \"base model\" from step 1, i.e. a model that has been pre-trained on predicting the next token on internet text, and turns it into a \"chatbot\"/\"assistant\". This is done by fine-tuning the model on human instruction data, using the cross-entropy loss. This means that the model is still trained to predict the next token, although we now want the model to generate useful completions given an instruction like \"what are 10 things to do in London?\", \"How can I make pancakes?\" or \"Write me a poem about elephants\".\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, one requires human annotators to collect useful completions, on which we can train the model. OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to generate useful completions given instructions, like \"In London, you can visit the Big Ben and (...)\". A nice collection of openly available SFT datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-sft-datasets-65788b571bf8e371c4e4241a).\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, the model becomes more useful: rather than simply predicting the next token (which might give undesirable outputs, like generating follow-up questions rather than answering the question), we now make it more likely that the model will output useful completions for any instruction we give it. We basically steer it in the direction of generating useful completions which a human could have written given any instruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* the entire notebook is based on and can be seen as an annotated version of the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) developed by Hugging Face, and more specifically the [recipe](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/blob/main/recipes/zephyr-7b-beta/sft/config_lora.yaml) used to train Zephyr-7b-beta. Huge kudos to the team for creating this!\n",

Environmental impact: Bike commuting is a sustainable transportation option that does not contribute to air pollution, noise pollution, or greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with motorized vehicles. By choosing to bike instead of drive, you can help to reduce your carbon footprint and protect the environment. 3. Economic benefits: Biking can be a more cost-effective mode of transportation. By avoiding the cost of gas, insurance, and car maintenance, you can save money in the long run. Additionally, some cities may offer incentives or tax credits to encourage bike commuting. 4. Improved productivity: Biking to work can help to increase alertness and productivity by providing a morning exercise routine that can help you feel more energized throughout the day. 5. Free parking: Unlike cars, bikes do not require parking spaces or fees, which means that you can save money and time by not having to search for parking.

Environmental impact:\n",
            "   - According to the European Cyclists' Federation, a person cycling 10 km to work and back every day can save over 1,500 kg of CO2 emissions per year, compared to traveling by car. - The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that if Americans replaced just one car trip per day with a bike ride, it would save 2 billion gallons of gas and reduce carbon emissions by 22 billion pounds per year. 3. Economic benefits:\n",
            "   - According to the Bicycle Commuter Act, a tax credit of up to $240 per year is available for employees who bike to work. - A study from the University of California found that employers can save up to $7,000 per year for each employee who bikes to work instead of driving. 4. Improved productivity:\n",

            "1. Get the right gear: Good gear can make your ride more comfortable and safer. You will need a helmet, a sturdy bike lock or secure parking space, and clothing appropriate for the weather conditions. If you are biking at night or in low-light conditions, be sure to wear reflective clothing or add reflective tape to your bike or helmet. 2. Plan your route: Research your route and choose one that is safe and convenient for your skill level. Consider bike-friendly roads or bike lanes, and avoid busy streets or heavy traffic areas. Many cities have online resources or maps of bike routes that you can use to plan your commute. 3. Practice safety precautions: Always obey traffic laws, including stop signs and traffic signals. Use hand signals to indicate when you are turning or stopping. Be visible, especially in low-light conditions, by using lights and reflective clothing. Always wear a helmet to protect your head. 4. Start slowly: If you are new to biking or haven't ridden in a while, start with short rides and gradually increase your distance and speed. Be patient with yourself and don't push yourself too hard. 5. Be prepared: Bring a small toolkit with you, including a spare tube, tire levers, and a pump. Make sure your bike is in good working condition before you set out on a ride. 6. Consider taking a bike safety class: Many cities offer bike safety classes that can help you learn the rules of the road and improve your cycling skills. Following these tips can help make your bike commute more enjoyable, safe, and easy.</s>\n",

Hence, for a 7 billion parameter model like Mistral-7B, one requires 7 billion parameters \\* 4 bytes per parameter = 28 GB of GPU RAM, just to load the model. During training with an optimizer like AdamW, one not only requires memory for the model but also for the gradients and optimizer states, which roughly comes down to approximately 18 times the size of the model in gigabytes when training with mixed precision, in this case 7 * 18 = 126 GB of GPU RAM.

It's a popular method for fine-tuning models in a parameter-efficient way, by only training a few adapters, keeping the existing model untouched. LoRa is available in the [PEFT library](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/index) by Hugging Face, which also supports various other PEFT methods (but LoRa is the most popular one at the time of writing).\n",

However, there have been new methods developed to shrink the size of a model considerably, to 8 or 4 bits per parameter (we call this [\"quantization\"](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization)). Hence, if we apply LoRa to a quantized model (like a 4-bit model), then we call this QLoRa. We have a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) that tells you all about it.

This class inherits from the Trainer class available in the Transformers library, but is specifically optimized for supervised fine-tuning (instruction tuning). It can be used to train out-of-the-box on one or more GPUs, using [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) as backend.\n",

        "As we're going to use QLoRa, the PEFT library provides a handy [LoraConfig](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/package_reference/lora#peft.LoraConfig) which defines on which layers of the base model to apply the adapters. One typically applies LoRa on the linear projection matrices of the attention layers of a Transformer. We then provide this configuration to the SFTTrainer class. The weights of the base model will be loaded as we specify the `model_id` (this requires some time).\n",

        "* we're going to use gradient checkpointing (yet another way to save memory during training)\n",
